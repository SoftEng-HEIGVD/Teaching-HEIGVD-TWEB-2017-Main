# Welcome!

This is the main online venue for TWEB 2017, a course on modern web development taught at the [HEIG-VD](http://www.heig-vd.ch) in Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland.

## Objectives

The first objective of the course is to become familiar with the rich and constantly evolving ecosystem of web technologies. We will look at many tools, frameworks and techniques. At the end of the course, you should be able to describe what "categories" of tools exist and how they complement each other. You should be able to explain what is in the arsenal of a modern web developer.

> We will write end-to-end applications and see that Javascript can be used on the client and on the server. We will store data in different types of databases. We will write interactive apps. We will create beautiful visualizations.

The second objective is to improve core Javascript skills. Throughout the course, we will review constructs and talk about the evolution of the language. We will compare "old-style" Javascript idioms with "ES6" idioms. One of the recurrent topics will be asynchronous programming. We will compare different ways to write asynchronous code. We will talk about callbacks and promises, but also about async/await and reactive extensions.

## Code, code, code

While we will present concepts during the lectures, we will put a strong focus on coding. During the semester, we will work on three different projects. Each project will be done in one iteration of 4-5 weeks. During the last 3 weeks of the semester, you will present and demonstrate your entire portfolios.

Every iteration will have a specific theme. Within the theme, we hope that you will be very creative and build original, beautiful and engaging prototypes. The 3 themes are:

* GitHub Analytics
* Digital Storytelling
* Gamification
