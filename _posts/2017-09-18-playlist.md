P.S. Last year, we already recorded a [bunch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfKkysTy70QYPeZz5irRl6gWXt9109B4F) of videos. Some of them are still relevant and will be useful for this edition of the course. Feel free to look around. Just be aware that in some cases, the tools and frameworks have evolved. You will need to adapt some of the operations.
